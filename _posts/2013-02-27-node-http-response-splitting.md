Web application developer should be aware of the HTTP Response Splitting threat.  Fortunately, there have efforts to add protections against this threat in the core Node.js code.  That being said, the protections are not widespread and there is a possibility for them to be bypassed.

## Overview of HTTP Response Splitting

Within a single HTTP response message header it is possible to terminate the response headers with carriage return line feed (CRLF) characters and send multiple response message headers http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec6.html.   As a result, when an attacker has control of any part of the HTTP response header they are able to trick a browser into rendering their response instead of the one that the developer intends to send.  What is more, since the response comes from the same origin as the web application the attacker has access to any origin dependent properties, namely cookies.

To learn more about HTTP response splitting please visit the Web Application Security Consortiums (WASC) Threat Classification page [http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246931/HTTP%20Response%20Splitting].

## Splitting a Response

The following is a perfectly valid HTTP Response to a single request.


	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Content-Length: 0
	 
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Content-Type: text/html
	Content-Length: 19
	 
	<html>HACKED</html>
	Date: Sat, 02 Feb 2013 18:35:04 GMT
	Connection: keep-alive

The above response was generated using only the `ServerResponse.prototype.writeHead` function.  Below is the code that generates the previous response (Node.js 0.8.18).

	var http = require('http');
	 
	http.createServer(function (req, res) {
	  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Length': '0\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\nContent-Length: 19\r\n\r\n<html>HACKED</html>' });
	  res.end();
	}).listen(8000, '127.0.0.1');

When Safari makes a request to this server it will render the message body from the second part of the response (figure 1.1).

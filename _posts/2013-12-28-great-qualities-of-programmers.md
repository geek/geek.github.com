Over the years I have had the privilege to work with a few programmers that possess certain
qualities that I consider to be great.  This is not to say that the programmers themselves are
great, but instead that they tend to exhibit greatness.  My point is that even a programmer
that generates many bugs can still be creative and empathetic, two qualities that I
consider to be great to have as a programmer.  Below is a non-exhaustive listing of the various
qualities that I believe can make a programmer wonderful to work with.

This post is mainly a reaction to the various types of bad programmers posts that exist.  It is an
attempt to frame the discussion in a more positive and optimistic light.


#### Succinct

I observed this quality in a fellow developer at my first job out of college.  We would have daily
status meetings and when their turn came they would often give a two word status update if that is
all that was required.  They would not exaggerate what they had done or were working on.  I asked
why they didn't list everything they were working on and they said that it would be a waste of
time.  When you assemble even 4 people in a meeting every minute that goes by is 4 minutes potentially
wasted.  I love when people only say what needs to be said and do not feel the need to spend
more time talking than is necessary.


#### Feedback is Welcome

I have only worked with one or two people over the years that actually enjoys feedback on their code.
Developers love to say that they enjoy and welcome criticism of their code, but very few really do.
However, the ones that do are amazing to work with.  These are people that will take suggestions and
feedback and not become defensive or passive aggressive at a later time, instead they will say
thank you and follow the advice.  The way that feedback is handled leads to the next
quality.


#### Empathetic

Developers that try and see things from another persons perspective are great to work with.  I don't
think this quality needs much explanation, it should be obvious why its necessary in a team or
community.


#### Passionate hatred of abstract/complex code

I love to work with people who possess this quality.  I will have to write another post just on why I
hate with a passion overly complicated solutions to problems or of solutions hidden deep inside of
abstract structures.  People who really do not like complex code are wonderful to get feedback from,
you can learn a great deal from them on building maintainable code.


#### Creative Hobbyist

Developers that do not simply copy-paste solutions are usually creative spirits.  For this reason
the most creative programmers I have worked with often have many creative hobbies outside of work.


### Conclusion

Again, this is not an exhaustive list and there are many other great qualities to possess.  These are
just a few that come to mind when I reflect on people I have enjoyed working with over the years.

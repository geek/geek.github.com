			<h1>Node Foundation Board Nomination</h1>
			<h2 class="headline">I&#39;m running to represent individual members on the Node.js Foundation Board of Directors </h2>
		</header>
		<section id="post-body">
			

<p>My name is Wyatt Preul, and I'd like to represent all individual members as part
of the Node.js Foundation Board of Directors.</p>

<p>As a representative I will do my part to make sure that individual members are
represented well.  As an active maintainer of <a href="http://npmjs.com/~wyatt">many Node.js modules</a> that large
<a href="https://gist.github.com/bcoe/dcc961b869bbf6685002">numbers in the community use</a>, as well as someone who enjoys contributing to
<a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/AUTHORS#L469">Node.js core</a> itself, I feel like I am well positioned to hear and voice the opinions
of the community.  Even more, I am an active Node.js conference participant, both
in attendance and speaking.  To quantify this, I have attended a Node.js related
conference every month for the past five months.</p>

<p>I am also not new to Node.js or the community.  I have been an active participant
for several years, both in the role of a developer and community lead.  I ran our
local Kansas City meetup for a while before passing on the torch.</p>

<p>Other than my direct engagement with the Node.js community, I also enjoyed
getting to interact with many current board members as a representative on the
node advisory board.</p>

<p>On top of these experiences, my day job is at nearForm where I work on open source
Node.js projects, like <a href="http://senecajs.org/">Seneca</a>.  Previously, I worked at Walmart
where I helped develop <a href="http://hapijs.com/">hapi</a> and broaden the Node.js adoption in the enterprise.</p>

<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>
